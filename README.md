# Compiler

Hello I'm Yash

Just download the py file and run it on your virtual machine.
I have used a liberary called tkinter to make the interface.
You dont need any extra package to run it.


I also provided the Project Report and the synopsis report in case you want to copy it to your mini project.

Thankkuuu for Visiting.<3<3<3
